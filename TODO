 1. Right click to never use a recipe (Ill use a command like `/professionator reset` to clear this)
 2. Cache calculation result so it doesn't need to be recalculated every time the window opens
 3. Add a summary of all reagents the character needs to collect to craft all the recipes in the profession
    Have a section to show all reagents that the character has in their bags/bank that will be used
 4. Add all professions to the database
 5. Calculation engine needs to be updated to handle tools (like blacksmith hammer, etc)
 6. Calculation engine needs to be updated to check if adding reagents at previous steps will be cheaper to craft the recipe
 7. Calculation engine needs to be updated to use the reagents in the bags/bank of the character
    IN PROGRESS

 Test
 1. Test with all professions
 2. Different versions of the game (SOD and classic are the main targets)
